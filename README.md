I got tired of Pentadactyl not working properly on Firefox 22 and simply applied all patches that were available on the bug tracker and mailing list as of now (2013-06-13). I’m currently using this patched version and it appears to work. I do not plan on making this a fork of any kind, so please submit all patches, requests, bug reports to the original places.
